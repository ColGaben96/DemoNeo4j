# DemoNeo4j
UEB Java Proj to show how Neo4J DB Works. Made by @colgaben96 and @juanpa1522

# How to make it run?

This is a maven project. But, it is vital to have these tools running.

## 1. Download and Install Neo4J Desktop

You can enter to this URL
<pre>https://neo4j.com/download/</pre>
Fill out the form, and follow the instructions. <b>WARNING</b>: This is a 522 MB installer. So you better have space and patience until it downloads and installs.

## 2. Add a new project 

Can be named "DemoNeo4J", and run the .sql script from this route in the DBA
<pre>scripts\database_build.sql</pre>

## 3. Configure your Tomcat Server

You can do it using IntelliJ, Eclipse, Netbeans or whatever Java IDE you want to use very easily. Since you have minimum knowledge of what you are doing, there won't be any trouble with.

## 4. KEEP !@#$% YOUR SYSTEM UPDATED

If you don't have this step you may incur in some incompatibility issues and some other that I won't solve.
